## TD 1 : Python,Git,Linux

### Exercise 1: Move around
1. Go to the root directory:```cd /```
2. Display the content of the current (root) directory: ```ls /```
3. Check your current location: ```pwd```
4. Try to create a directory named test: ```sudo mkdir test``` parce que sans le “sudo”, on n’a pas la permission.
5. Go to the general home directory (should contain folders named after each user): ```cd /home```
6. Go to your home directory: voir question 5.
7. Go back to the general home directory (located "just above"): ```cd ..```
8. Go again "just above", you should be back to the root directory: ```cd ..```
9. Go directly to your home directory (named after you). It should be a very simple command, which take no name as parameter of the path: ```cd```
10. Try to create a directory named test: ```mkdir test```
11. Go into this new directory: ```cd test```
12. Check your current location: ```pwd```

### Exercise 2: Create, Rename, copy, delete.
1. Go to your home directory (should be named after you, you might be there by default): ```cd mateo_grandemange```
2. Check your current location: ```pwd```
3. Create a folder linux_ex_1: ```mkdir linux_ex_1```
4. Go into this folder: ```cd linux_ex_1```
5. Create an empty text file named [first_name]_[last_name].txt (e.g. alexis_bogroff.txt): ```vim mateo_g.txt```
6. Create a folder notes: ```mkdir notes```
7. Move your text file into this folder: ```mv mateo_g.txt notes/```
8. Rename the text file by appending the current year [first_name]_[last_name]_[current_year].txt : mv mateo_g.txt mateo_g_2023.txt
9. Make a copy of this folder, name it notes_2022: ```cp -r notes/ notes_2022```
10. Delete the first folder (notes) using the verbose option: ```rm -rv notes```

### Exercise 3: Create and run a script
1. Create a script script_1.sh in the folder linux_ex_1 ```vim script_1.sh```
2. In the script, write the commands that would output the following :
Script running please wait ...
Done.
```echo "Script running please wait ..."```
```echo "Done."```
3. Quit editing and save the script ```:wq```
4. Display the content of the script (using a command, not from an editor) ```echo -e "Script running please wait ...\nDone."```
5. Run the script ```source script_1.sh```

### Exercise 4: Accessing or modifying a file : permissions and root privilege

#### 1 Change the rights for accessing or modifying a file
1. Create a file credentials in the folder linux_ex_1 ```vim credentials.sh```
2. 
    (a) Write any kind of (fake) personal information within the file       
    ```i```
    ```Bonjour je m'appelle Mateo```
    ```:wq```
    
    (b) Display the file content ```. credentials.sh```
    
    (c) Display the current permissions```ls -l credentials.sh ```
    
2. Change the current permissions to : read only for all users ```chmod 444 credentials.sh```

    (a) Display the new permissions```ls -l credentials.sh```
    
    (b) Modify and save the file : On ne peut pas, il faut rajouter un “!” pour override
    
    (c) Display the file content```. credentials.sh```
    
3. Change the permissions back to read and write for all users```chmod ugo+rw credentials.sh```

    (a) Display the new permissions```ls -l credentials.sh```
    
    (b) Modify and save the file
    ```vim credentials.sh```
    ```J'ai 10 ans```
    ```:wq```
    
    (c) Display the file content ```. credentials.sh```

On the same file :
1. Add the execute permission to the owner ```chmod u+x credentials.sh```

    (a) Display the new permissions ```ls -l credentials.sh```
    Output :
    -rwxrw-rw- 1 mateo_grandemange mateo_grandemange 72 Feb 20 14:12 credentials.sh
    
2. Remove the read permission to other users 
    ```chmod o-r credentials.sh```
    
    (a) Display the new permissions ```ls -l credentials.sh```
    Output:
    -rwxrw--w- 1 mateo_grandemange mateo_grandemange 72 Feb 20 14:12 credentials.sh

3. Change the permissions to read, write and execute for all users 
    ```chmod a+rwx credentials.sh```
    
    (a) Display the new permissions```ls -l credentials.sh```
    Output:
    -rwxrwxrwx 1 mateo_grandemange mateo_grandemange 72 Feb 20 14:12 credentials.sh
    
#### 2 Access root files
1. Go to the root folder ```cd /```

2. Create a file in root user mode named .private_file  ```sudo touch .private_file```

    (a) Write some information in the file 
    ```sudo -i```
    ``` touch .private_file```
    ``` echo "It is a private file" > .private_file ```

    (b) Display the file content
    ``` cat .private_file```

    (c) Display all the files in the folder including hidden files
    ```ls -a```

3. Modify the file in normal user mode

    (a) Write some new information in the file
    Impossible, la permission est refusée lorsqu'on est pas en mode             utilisateur normal
    (b) Display the file content
    Impossible aussi.

4. Modify the file in root user mode

    (a) Write some new information in the file
    ```sudo -i```
    ```vim .private_file```
    ```i```
    ```Modified```
    
    (b) Display the file content
    ```cat private_file
    
5. Change permissions to read, write and execute for all users
    ``` cd ..```
    ``` chmod a=rwx root```
    
    (a) Modify the file content in normal user mode
    ```echo "Je suis zorro" >> .private_file```

    (b) Display the file content
    ``` cat private_file ```
